# Real_time-E-commerce_Herd_Behavior_Alert
HerdWatch monitors live e-commerce interactions to detect abnormal activity spikes and uncover trending products in real time. Using Kafka, Python, and React, it provides instant alerts, interactive dashboards, and insights to help businesses stay ahead of customer trends.

## Problem Statement
This project aims to develop a **Real time analytics platform for e-commerce websites** that detects **"Herd behavior"** a sudden and unusual surge in user activity on specific products.  
The system identifies trending items as they emerge, allowing businesses to react immediately to organic customer interest and viral trends.
